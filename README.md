# VRDisco
UChicago Mobile Computing Project

Summary: 

VR Disco is an immersive social virtual experience that caters to the music festival going crowd, specifically the Electronic Dance Music (EDM) community. However moving forward, it can also be used as a platform for other genres and music communities, such as rock, rap, classical etc. We provide a real music festival experience (similar to Spring Awakening or Ultra), right through your Android phone and Google Cardboard Headset. Listen and Dance to a live DJ on a surreal venue without ever having to leave your room. Your dance moves are mimicked through through an avatar, so you can rock out with all your friends to your favorite songs.
